The examples.ipynb contains an iPython Notbook with a number of
examples to run directly on your computer. You're encouraged
to try them out for yourself.

If you don't want to bother, there's a print of the
output in the *examples.pdf* file for your viewing pleasure.

If nothing can stop you however, install the dependencies first:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

And run ipython notbook second:

    ipython notbook --pylab inline

Then click on "examples", followed by "Cell -> Run All"

This will take a while on the first run as a quarter million records
are transferred to an Sqlite file.
